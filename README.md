# WIP building tools for the PrivOS project, based on the awesome work by [live-custom-ubuntu-from-scratch](https://github.com/mvallim/live-custom-ubuntu-from-scratch)

This is a project to create a privacy-first Ubuntu derivative as a learning experience by some 42-Barcelona students.
Now everything is an extremely experimental weekend project, but it will keep improving.
